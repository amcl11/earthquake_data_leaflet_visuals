# Module 15 - Mapping / Data Visualisation 

## Project Overview

In this challenge I used GeoJSON earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to map and visualise earthquake data from the last 30 days.
The data was sourced on Wednesday 6th September 2023.

The final map visualisation reflects the magnitude of the earthquakes (by makrker size), as well as the depth of the earthquake (represented by a darker marker colour). 

## Raw Data
Sourced from [earthquake.usgs.gov](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
Specific 30 day data pulled as of Wed 6th Sept is located at this [LINK](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson)
